## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

**MP1** Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

**MP2** Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

**MP4** Model with mathematics.

**MP5** Use appropriate tools strategically.

**MP7** Look for and make use of structure.

**MP8** Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

#### High School — Number and Quantity

##### Quantities

**N-Q.A.2** Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.

#### High School — Algebra

##### Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities

**A-REI.D.11** Explain why the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs of the equations _y = f(x)_ and _y = g(x)_ intersect are the solutions of the equation _f(x) = g(x)_; find the solutions approximately,
e.g., using technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find successive approximations. Include cases where _f(x)_ and/or _g(x)_ are linear, polynomial, rational, absolute value, exponential, and logarithmic functions.

#### High School — Functions

##### Interpretting Functions

**F-IF.B.4**
For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and
tables in terms of the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the
relationship.
_Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity._

**F-IF.B.6** Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function (presented symbolically or as a table) over a
specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.

##### Building Functions

**F-BF.A.1b**
Combine standard function types using arithmetic operations.
_For example, build a function that models the temperature of a cooling body by adding a constant function to a decaying exponential, and relate these functions to the model._

**F-BF.B.3** Identify the effect on the graph of replacing _f(x)_ by _f(x) + k_, _k f(x)_, _f(kx)_, and _f(x + k)_ for specific values of
_k_ (both positive and negative); find the value of _k_ given the graphs. Experiment with cases and illustrate an
explanation of the effects on the graph using technology.
_Include recognizing even and odd functions from their graphs and algebraic expressions for them._

**F-BF.B.4a** Solve an equation of the form f(x) = c for a simple function f that has an inverse and write
an expression for the inverse. _For example, f(x) = 2x³ or f(x) = (x+1)/(x–1) for x ≠ 1._

#### High School — Statistics and Probability

##### Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data

**S-ID.B.6a** Fit a function to the data (including with the use of technology); use functions fitted to data to solve problems in the context of the data. _Use given functions or choose a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear and exponential models._

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9-10)
