## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

- **MP1**: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **MP2**: Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

- **MP6**: Attend to precision.

- **MP7**: Look for and make use of structure.

- **MP8**: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

#### High School — Number and Quantity

##### The Real Number System

- **N-RN.A.1**: Explain how the definition of the meaning of rational exponents follows from extending the properties of integer exponents to those values, allowing for a notation for radicals in terms of rational exponents. _For example, we define 5^(1/3) to be the cube root of 5 because we want (5^(1/3))^3 = 5(^1/3)^3 to hold, so (5^(1/3))^3 must equal 5._

- **N-RN.A.2**: Rewrite expressions involving radicals and rational exponents using the properties of exponents.

##### The Complex Number System

- **N-CN.A.1**: Know there is a complex number _i_ such that _i² = –1_, and every complex number has the form _a + bi_ with _a_ and _b_ real.

- **N-CN.A.2**: Use the relation _i² = –1_ and the commutative, associative, and distributive properties to add, subtract, and multiply complex numbers.

#### High School — Algebra

##### Seeing Structure in Expressions

- **A-SSE.A.2**: Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it. _For example, see x⁴ – y⁴ as (x²)² – (y²)² , thus recognizing it as a difference of squares that can be factored as (x² – y²)(x² + y²)._

- **A-SSE.B.3c**: Use the properties of exponents to transform expressions for exponential functions. _For example the expression 1.15^t can be rewritten as (1.15^(1/12))^12t ≈ 1.012^12t to reveal the approximate equivalent monthly interest rate if the annual rate is 15%._

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9–10)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

- **CRP2**: Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

- **CRP4**: Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

- **CRP6**: Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

- **CRP8**: Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **CRP10**: Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

- **CRP11**: Use technology to enhance productivity.

#### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation

- **9.2.12.C.1**: Review career goals and determine steps necessary for attainment.

- **9.2.12.C.9**: Analyze the correlation between personal and financial behavior and employability.
