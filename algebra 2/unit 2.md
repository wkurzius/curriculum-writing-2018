## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

**MP1** Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

**MP2** Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

**MP6** Attend to precision.

**MP7** Look for and make use of structure.

**MP8** Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

#### High School — Number and Quantity

##### The Real Number System

**N-RN.A.1** Explain how the definition of the meaning of rational exponents follows from extending the
properties of integer exponents to those values, allowing for a notation for radicals in terms
of rational exponents.
_For example, we define 5^(1/3) to be the cube root of 5 because we want (5^(1/3))^3 = 5(^1/3)^3 to hold, so (5^(1/3))^3 must equal 5._

**N-RN.A.2** Rewrite expressions involving radicals and rational exponents using the properties of
exponents.

##### The Complex Number System

**N-CN.A.1** Know there is a complex number _i_ such that _i² = –1_, and every complex number has the form
_a + bi_ with _a_ and _b_ real.

**N-CN.A.2** Use the relation _i² = –1_ and the commutative, associative, and distributive properties to add, subtract, and multiply complex numbers.

#### High School — Algebra

##### Seeing Structure in Expressions

**A-SSE.A.2** Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it.
_For example, see x⁴ – y⁴ as (x²)² – (y²)² , thus recognizing it as a difference of squares that can be factored as (x² – y²)(x² + y²)._

**A-SSE.B.3c** Use the properties of exponents to transform expressions for exponential functions.
_For example the expression 1.15^t can be rewritten as (1.15^(1/12))^12t ≈ 1.012^12t to reveal the approximate equivalent monthly interest rate if the annual rate is 15%._

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9-10)

**NJSLSA.R1** Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

**NJSLSA.R4** Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

**8.1.12.B.2** Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

**CRP2** Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

**CRP4** Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

**CRP6** Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

**CRP8** Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

**CRP10** Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

**CRP11** Use technology to enhance productivity.

#### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation

**9.2.12.C.1** Review career goals and determine steps necessary for attainment.

**9.2.12.C.9** Analyze the correlation between personal and financial behavior and employability.
