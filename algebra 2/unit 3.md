#### High School — Number and Quantity

##### The Complex Number System

- **N-CN.C.7**: Solve quadratic equations with real coefficients that have complex solutions.

#### High School — Algebra

##### Creating Equations

- **A-CED.A.1**: Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems. Include equations arising
from linear and quadratic functions, and simple rational and exponential functions.

##### Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities

- **A-REI.A.1**: Explain each step in solving a simple equation or systems of equations as following from the equality of
numbers asserted at the previous step, starting from the assumption that the original equation has a
solution. Construct a viable argument to justify a solution method. Reason about the nature of solutions.

- **A-REI.A.2**: Solve simple rational and radical equations in one variable, and give examples showing how extraneous
solutions may arise.

- **A-REI.B.4b**: Solve quadratic equations in one variable.
Solve quadratic equations by inspection (e.g. for _x² = 49_), taking square roots, completing the square, the quadratic formula and factoring, as appropriate to the initial form of the equation. Recognize when the quadratic formula gives complex solutions and write them as _a ± bi_ for real numbers _a_ and _b_.

- **A-REI.C.6**: Solve systems of linear equations exactly and approximately (e.g., with graphs), focusing on linear equations
in three variables.

- **A-REI.C.7**: Solve a simple system consisting of a linear equation and a quadratic equation in two variables algebraically
and graphically.
_For example, find the points of intersection between the line y = −3x and the circle x² + y² = 3._

- **A-REI.D.11**: Explain why the _x_-coordinates of the points where the graphs of the equations _y = f(x)_ and _y = g(x)_ intersect are the solutions of the equation _f(x) = g(x)_;
find the solutions approximately, e.g. using technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find successive approximations.
Include cases where _f(x)_ and/or _g(x)_ are linear, polynomial, rational, absolute value, exponential, and logarithmic
functions.
