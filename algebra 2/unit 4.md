## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

**MP1** Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

**MP2** Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

**MP4** Model with mathematics.

**MP5** Use appropriate tools strategically.

**MP6** Attend to precision.

**MP7** Look for and make use of structure.

#### High School — Algebra

##### Seeing Structure in Expressions

**A-SSE.B.3c** Use the properties of exponents to transform expressions for exponential functions.
_For example the expression 1.15^t can be rewritten as (1.15^(1/12))^12t ≈ 1.012^12t to reveal the approximate equivalent monthly interest rate if the annual rate is 15%._

#### High School — Functions

##### Interpretting Functions

**F-IF.B.4**
For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and tables
in terms of the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the
relationship. Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive,
or negative; relative maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.

**F-IF.B.6**
Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function (presented symbolically or as a table) over a
specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.

**F-IF.C.7e**
Graph exponential and logarithmic functions, showing intercepts and end behavior, and trigonometric functions, showing period, midline, and amplitude.

**F-IF.C.8b**
Use the properties of exponents to interpret expressions for exponential functions.
_For example, identify percent rate of change in functions such as y = (1.02)^t , y = (0.97)^t , y = (1.01)^12t , y = (1.2)^t/10, and classify them as representing exponential growth or decay._

##### Building Functions

**F-BF.A.1b**
Combine standard function types using arithmetic operations.
_For example, build a function that models the temperature of a cooling body by adding a constant function to a decaying exponential, and relate these functions to the model._

**F-BF.B.4a** Solve an equation of the form f(x) = c for a simple function f that has an inverse and write
an expression for the inverse. _For example, f(x) = 2x³ or f(x) = (x+1)/(x–1) for x ≠ 1._

##### Linear and Exponential Models

**F-LE.A.4** Understand the inverse relationship between exponents and logarithms. For exponential
models, express as a logarithm the solution to _ab^ct = d_ where _a_, _c_, and _d_ are numbers and the base _b_ is 2, 10, or _e_; evaluate the logarithm using technology.

**F-LE.B.5** Interpret the parameters in a linear or exponential function in terms of a context.

#### High School — Statistics and Probability

**S-ID.B.6a** Fit a function to the data (including with the use of technology); use functions fitted to data to solve problems in the context of the data. _Use given functions or choose a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear and exponential models._

##### Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9-10)

**NJSLSA.R1** Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

**NJSLSA.R4** Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

**8.1.12.B.2** Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

**CRP2** Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

**CRP4** Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

**CRP6** Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

**CRP8** Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

**CRP10** Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

**CRP11** Use technology to enhance productivity.

#### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation

**9.2.12.C.1** Review career goals and determine steps necessary for attainment.

**9.2.12.C.9** Analyze the correlation between personal and financial behavior and employability.
