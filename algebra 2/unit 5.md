**MP2** Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

**MP4** Model with mathematics.

**MP5** Use appropriate tools strategically.

**MP6** Attend to precision.

**MP7** Look for and make use of structure.

#### High School — Functions

##### Interpretting Functions

**F-IF.B.4**
For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and
tables in terms of the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the
relationship.
_Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity._

**F-IF.C.7e**
Graph exponential and logarithmic functions, showing intercepts and end behavior, and trigonometric functions, showing period, midline, and amplitude.

##### Trigonometric Functions

**F-TF.A.1**
Understand radian measure of an angle as the length of the arc on the unit circle subtended by the angle.

**F-TF.A.2**
Explain how the unit circle in the coordinate plane enables the extension of trigonometric functions to all real numbers, interpreted as radian measures of angles traversed counterclockwise around the unit circle.

**F-TF.B.5**
Choose trigonometric functions to model periodic phenomena with specified amplitude, frequency, and midline.

**F-TF.C.8**
Prove the Pythagorean identity sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1 and use it to find sin(θ), cos(θ), or tan(θ) given sin(θ), cos(θ), or tan(θ) and the quadrant of the angle.

#### High School — Statistics and Probability

##### Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data

**S-ID.B.6a** Fit a function to the data (including with the use of technology); use functions fitted to data to solve problems in the context of the data. _Use given functions or choose a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear and exponential models._

**NJSLSA.R4** Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.
