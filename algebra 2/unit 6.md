## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

- **MP1**: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **MP2**: Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

- **MP3**: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.

- **MP4**: Model with mathematics.

- **MP5**: Use appropriate tools strategically.

- **MP6**: Attend to precision.

- **MP7**: Look for and make use of structure.

- **MP8**: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

#### High School — Number and Quantity

##### Quantities

- **N-Q.A.2**: Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.

##### The Complex Number System

#### High School — Algebra

##### Arithmetic with Polynomials and Rational Expressions

- **A-APR.B.2**: Know and apply the Remainder Theorem: For a polynomial _p(x)_ and a number _a_, the remainder on division by _x – a_ is _p(a)_, so _p(a) = 0_ if and only if _(x – a)_ is a factor of _p(x)_.

- **A-APR.B.3**: Identify zeros of polynomials when suitable factorizations are available, and use the zeros to construct a rough graph of the function defined by the polynomial.

- **A-APR.C.4**: Prove polynomial identities and use them to describe numerical relationships. _For example, the difference of two squares; the sum and difference of two cubes; the polynomial identity (x² + y²)² = (x² – y²)² + (2xy)² can be used to generate Pythagorean triples._

- **A-APR.D.6**: Rewrite simple rational expressions in different forms; write _a(x)/b(x)_ in the form _q(x) + r(x)/b(x)_, where _a(x)_, _b(x)_, _q(x)_, and _r(x)_ are polynomials with the degree of _r(x)_ less than the degree of _b(x)_, using inspection, long division, or, for the more complicated examples, a computer algebra system.

##### Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities

- **A-REI.B.4b**: Solve quadratic equations by inspection (e.g. for _x² = 49_), taking square roots, completing the square, the quadratic formula and factoring, as appropriate to the initial form of the equation. Recognize when the quadratic formula gives complex solutions and write them as _a ± bi_ for real numbers _a_ and _b_.

#### High School — Functions

##### Interpretting Functions

- **F-IF.B.4**: For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the relationship. _Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity._

- **F-IF.C.7c**: Graph polynomial functions, identifying zeros when suitable factorizations are available, and showing end behavior.

- **F-IF.C.9**: Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by verbal descriptions). _For example, given a graph of one quadratic function and an algebraic expression for another, say which has the larger maximum._

##### Building Functions

- **F-BF.A.1b**: Combine standard function types using arithmetic operations. _For example, build a function that models the temperature of a cooling body by adding a constant function to a decaying exponential, and relate these functions to the model._

##### Linear and Exponential Models

#### High School — Statistics and Probability

##### Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data

- **S-ID.B.6a**: Fit a function to the data (including with the use of technology); use functions fitted to data to solve problems in the context of the data. _Use given functions or choose a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear and exponential models._

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9–10)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

- **CRP2**: Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

- **CRP4**: Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

- **CRP6**: Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

- **CRP8**: Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **CRP10**: Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.
