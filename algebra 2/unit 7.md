##### Seeing Structure in Expressions

**A-SSE.B.4**
Derive and/or explain the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series (when the common ratio is not 1), and use the formula to solve problems.
_For example, calculate mortgage payments._

#### High School — Functions

##### Interpretting Functions

**F-IF.A.3**
Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.
_For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) for n ≥ 1._

##### Building Functions

**F-BF.A.1a**
Determine an explicit expression, a recursive process, or steps for calculation from a context.

**F-BF.A.2**
Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms.

##### Linear and Exponential Models

**F-LE.A.2**
Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table)

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9-10)

**NJSLSA.R1** Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

**NJSLSA.R4** Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

**8.1.12.B.2** Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

**CRP2** Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.
