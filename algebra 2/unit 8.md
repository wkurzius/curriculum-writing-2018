# Unit 8: Inferences and conclusions from data

## Unit Overview

**Content area:** Algebra 2

**Unit title:** Inferences and conclusions from data

**Unit time frame:** 15 days

**Target Course/Grade Level:** 11

**Unit Summary:** This unit acts as an introduction to high school statistics. It touches on proper data gathering, normal distributions, z-scores, and making inferences from survey and experiments.

## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

**MP1** Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

**MP2** Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

**MP3** Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.

**MP4** Model with mathematics.

**MP5** Use appropriate tools strategically.

**MP6** Attend to precision.

**MP8** Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

#### High School — Statistics and Probability

##### Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data

**S-ID.A.4**
Use the mean and standard deviation of a data set to fit it to a normal distribution and to estimate population percentages. Recognize that there are data sets for which such a procedure is not appropriate. Use calculators, spreadsheets, and tables to estimate areas under the normal curve.

##### Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions

**S-IC.A.1**
Understand statistics as a process for making inferences about population parameters based on a random sample from that population.

**S-IC.A.2**
Decide if a specified model is consistent with results from a given data-generating process, e.g., using simulation.
_For example, a model says a spinning coin falls heads up with probability 0.5. Would a result of 5 tails in a row cause you to question the model?_

**S-IC.B.3**
Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.

**S-IC.B.4**
Use data from a sample survey to estimate a population mean or proportion; develop a margin of error through the use of simulation models for random sampling.

**S-IC.B.5**
Use data from a randomized experiment to compare two treatments; use simulations to decide if differences between parameters are significant.

**S-IC.B.6**
Evaluate reports based on data.

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9-10)

**NJSLSA.R1** Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

**NJSLSA.R4** Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

**8.1.12.B.2** Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

**CRP2** Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

**CRP4** Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

**CRP6** Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

**CRP8** Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

**CRP10** Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

**CRP11** Use technology to enhance productivity.

#### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation

**9.2.12.C.1** Review career goals and determine steps necessary for attainment.

**9.2.12.C.9** Analyze the correlation between personal and financial behavior and employability.

## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- What does it mean to make an inference?
- What are some considerations when undertaking a statistical study or experiment?
- How can and when should you use a sample data to infer a conclusion about a population?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- Statistical inference is a tool for validating a claim about a population parameter.
- Poorly data collection introduces bias that cannot be overcome by statistical methods.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- The measures of central tendency.
- The measures of variation.
- What bias is and how to identify it.
- The binomial theorem.

### Unit learning expectations (Ability)

_Students will be able to..._

- Using Normal Distributions
  - Calculate probabilities using normal distributions.
  - Use z-scores and the standard normal table to find probabilities.
  - Recognize data sets that are normal.
- Populations, Samples, and Hypotheses
  - Distinguish between a sample and a population.
  - Analyze hypotheses. Note: This is an informal analysis. For example, a student may be asked to examine a histogram of simulated data and asked whether a claim could be true.
- Collecting Data
  - Identify types of sampling methods in statistical studies.
  - Recognize bias in sampling.
  - Analyze methods of collecting data.
  - Recognize bias in survey questions.
- Experimental Design
  - Describe experiments.
  - Recognize how randomization applies to experiments and observational studies.
  - Analyze experimental designs.
- Making Inferences from Sample Surveys
  - Estimate population parameters.
  - Analyze (informally) estimated population parameters.
  - Find margins of errors for surveys.
- Making Inferences from Experiments
  - Organize data from an experiment with two samples.
  - Re-sample data using simulation to analyze a hypothesis.
  - Make inferences about a treatment.
