## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

**MP1** Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

**MP2** Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

**MP3** Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.

**MP4** Model with mathematics.

**MP5** Use appropriate tools strategically.

**MP6** Attend to precision.

**MP8** Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

#### High School — Statistics and Probability

##### Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data

**S-ID.A.4**
Use the mean and standard deviation of a data set to fit it to a normal distribution and to estimate population percentages. Recognize that there are data sets for which such a procedure is not appropriate. Use calculators, spreadsheets, and tables to estimate areas under the normal curve.

##### Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions

**S-IC.A.1**
Understand statistics as a process for making inferences about population parameters based on a random sample from that population.

**S-IC.A.2**
Decide if a specified model is consistent with results from a given data-generating process, e.g., using simulation.
_For example, a model says a spinning coin falls heads up with probability 0.5. Would a result of 5 tails in a row cause you to question the model?_

**S-IC.B.3**
Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.

**S-IC.B.4**
Use data from a sample survey to estimate a population mean or proportion; develop a margin of error through the use of simulation models for random sampling.

**S-IC.B.5**
Use data from a randomized experiment to compare two treatments; use simulations to decide if differences between parameters are significant.

**S-IC.B.6**
Evaluate reports based on data.

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9-10)

**NJSLSA.R1** Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

**NJSLSA.R4** Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

**8.1.12.B.2** Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

**CRP2** Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

**CRP4** Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

**CRP6** Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

**CRP8** Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
