#### High School — Statistics and Probability

##### Conditional Probability and the Rules of Probability

**S-CP.A.1**
Describe events as subsets of a sample space (the set of outcomes) using characteristics (or categories) of the outcomes, or as unions, intersections, or complements of other events (“or”, “and”, “not”)

**S-CP.A.2**
Understand that two events A and B are independent if the probability of A and B occurring together is the product of their probabilities, and use this characterization to determine if they are independent.

**S-CP.A.3**
Understand the conditional probability of _A_ given _B_ as _P(A_ and _B)/P(B)_, and interpret independence of _A_ and _B_ as saying that the conditional probability of _A_ given _B_ is the same as the probability of _A_, and the conditional probability of _B_ given _A_ is the same as the probability of _B_.

**S-CP.A.4**
Construct and interpret two-way frequency tables of data when two categories are associated with each object being classified. Use the two-way table as a sample space to decide if events are independent and to approximate conditional probabilities.
_For example, collect data from a random sample of students in your school on their favorite subject among math, science, and English. Estimate the probability that a randomly selected student from your school will favor science given that the student is in tenth grade. Do the same for other subjects and compare the results._

**S-CP.A.5**
Recognize and explain the concepts of conditional probability and independence in everyday language and everyday situations.
_For example, compare the chance of having lung cancer if you are a smoker with the chance of being a smoker if you have lung cancer._

**S-CP.B.6**
Find the conditional probability of _A_ given _B_ as the fraction of _B_’s outcomes that also belong to _A_, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.

**S-CP.B.7**
Apply the Addition Rule, _P(A_ or _B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A_ and _B)_, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
