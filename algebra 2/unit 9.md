# Unit 9: Probability

## Unit Overview

- **Content area**: Algebra 2

- **Unit title**: Probability

- **Unit time frame**: 10 days

- **Target Course/Grade Level**: 11

- **Unit Summary**: This unit is a more complex look at probabilty, including looking at sample spaces, complementary events, and conditional events. It also applies probability to two-way tables to find marginal and conditional relative frequencies.

## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

- **MP3**: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.

- **MP4**: Model with mathematics.

- **MP5**: Use appropriate tools strategically.

#### High School — Statistics and Probability

##### Conditional Probability and the Rules of Probability

- **S-CP.A.1**: Describe events as subsets of a sample space (the set of outcomes) using characteristics (or categories) of the outcomes, or as unions, intersections, or complements of other events (“or”, “and”, “not”)

- **S-CP.A.2**: Understand that two events A and B are independent if the probability of A and B occurring together is the product of their probabilities, and use this characterization to determine if they are independent.

- **S-CP.A.3**: Understand the conditional probability of _A_ given _B_ as _P(A_ and _B)/P(B)_, and interpret independence of _A_ and _B_ as saying that the conditional probability of _A_ given _B_ is the same as the probability of _A_, and the conditional probability of _B_ given _A_ is the same as the probability of _B_.

- **S-CP.A.4**: Construct and interpret two-way frequency tables of data when two categories are associated with each object being classified. Use the two-way table as a sample space to decide if events are independent and to approximate conditional probabilities. _For example, collect data from a random sample of students in your school on their favorite subject among math, science, and English. Estimate the probability that a randomly selected student from your school will favor science given that the student is in tenth grade. Do the same for other subjects and compare the results._

- **S-CP.A.5**: Recognize and explain the concepts of conditional probability and independence in everyday language and everyday situations. _For example, compare the chance of having lung cancer if you are a smoker with the chance of being a smoker if you have lung cancer._

- **S-CP.B.6**: Find the conditional probability of _A_ given _B_ as the fraction of _B_’s outcomes that also belong to _A_, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.

- **S-CP.B.7**: Apply the Addition Rule, _P(A_ or _B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A_ and _B)_, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9–10)

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

- **CRP2**: Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

- **CRP4**: Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- Why is the notion of dependence important to the study of probability?

- How can you determine the frequency of each outcome of an event?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- Random phenomena are unpredictable in the short term yet exhibit long term regular frequency.

- The probability of any outcome of a random phenomenon is the proportion of times the. outcome would occur in a very long series of repetitions.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- The difference between independent and dependent events.

- The multiplication principle.

- Marginal and conditional relative frequencies.

### Unit learning expectations (Ability)

_Students will be able to..._

- Sample Spaces and Probability

  - Find sample spaces by listing outcomes, applying the multiplication principle, or drawing tree diagrams.

  - Find theoretical probabilities as a ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

  - Apply the concept of complementary events.

- Independent and Dependent Events

  - Determine whether two events are independent events.

  - Find probabilities of independent and dependent (i.e. conditional) events.

- Two-way Tables and Probability

  - Find marginal and conditional relative frequencies.

  - Interpret two-way tables and use conditional relative frequencies to calculate conditional probabilities.

- Probability of Disjoint and Overlapping Events

  - Develop a Venn diagram for a given situation.

  - Find probabilities of compound events by applying the addition rule.

  - Apply multiple probability rules to solve real-life problems.
