_Students will understand..._

- Algebra uses symbols to represent quantities that are unknown or that vary. Mathematical phrases and real-world relationships can be represented using symbols and operations.
- The definition of a square root can be used to find the exact square roots of some non-negative numbers. The square roots of other non-negative nubers can be approximated.
- Numbers can be classified by their characteristics. Some types of numbers can be reprsented on the number line.
- Any real numbers can be added or subtracted using a number line model or using rules involving absolute value.
- The rules for multiplying real numbers are related to the properties of real numbers and the definitions of operations.
- The distributive property can be used to simplify the product of a number and a sum or difference.
- An algebraic expression can be simplifued by combining the parts of the expresson that are alike.
- Sometimes the value of of one quantity can be found if the value of another is known. The relationship between the quantities can be represented in different ways, including tables, equations, and graphs.

- When simplifying an expression operations must be performed in the correct order.
- Powers can be used to shorten the representation of repeated multiplication.
- Relationships that are always true for real numbers are called properties, which are rules used to rewrite and compare expressions.
