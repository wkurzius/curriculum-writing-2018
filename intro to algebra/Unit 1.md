- **MP7**: Look for and make use of structure.

#### High School — Number and Quantity

##### The Real Number System

- **N-RN.B.3**: Explain why the sum or product of two rational numbers is rational; that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational; and that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.

#### High School — Algebra

##### Seeing Structure in Expressions

- **A-SSE.A.1**: Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context.

- **A-SSE.A.1a**: Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coefficients

##### Creating Equations

- **A-CED.A.1**: Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems. Include equations arising from linear and quadratic functions, and simple rational and exponential functions.

## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- How can you represent quantities, patterns, and relationships?

- How are properties related to algebra?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- Algebra uses symbols to represent quantities that are unknown or that vary. Mathematical phrases and real-world relationships can be represented using symbols and operations.

- The definition of a square root can be used to find the exact square roots of some non-negative numbers. The square roots of other non-negative nubers can be approximated.

- Numbers can be classified by their characteristics. Some types of numbers can be reprsented on the number line.

- Any real numbers can be added or subtracted using a number line model or using rules involving absolute value.

- The rules for multiplying real numbers are related to the properties of real numbers and the definitions of operations.

- The distributive property can be used to simplify the product of a number and a sum or difference.

- An algebraic expression can be simplifued by combining the parts of the expresson that are alike.

- Sometimes the value of of one quantity can be found if the value of another is known. The relationship between the quantities can be represented in different ways, including tables, equations, and graphs.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- Vocabulary including absolute value, algebraic expression, base, coefficient, constant, Distributive Property, equation, evaluate, exponent,inequality, integer, irrational number, like terms, natural number, order of operations, perfect square, power, quantity, radical, radicand, rational number, real number, reciprocal, simplify, square root, term, variable, and whole number.

- When simplifying an expression operations must be performed in the correct order.

- Powers can be used to shorten the representation of repeated multiplication.

- Relationships that are always true for real numbers are called properties, which are rules used to rewrite and compare expressions.

- Equations are used to represent the relationsip between two quantities that have the same value.

### Unit learning expectations (Ability)

_Students will be able to..._

- Write algebraic expressions.

- Simplify expressions involving exponents.

- Use the order of operations to evaluate expressions.

- Classify, graph, and compare real numbers.

- Find and estimate square roots.

- Identfify and use properties of real numbers.

- Find sums and differences of real numbers.

- Find products and quotients of real numbers.

- Use the Distributive Property to simplify expressions.

- Solve equations using tables and mental math.

- Use tables, equations, and graphs to describe relationships.
