# Unit 2: Solving equations

## Unit Overview

- **Content area**: Introduction to Algebra

- **Unit title**: Solving equations

- **Unit time frame**: 34 days

- **Target Course/Grade Level**: 9

- **Unit Summary**: This unit introduces students to solving one-step equations then moves on to two-step and multi-step equations, then equations with variables on both sides. The unit also looks at solving literal equations where students solve equations with multiple variables.

  The unit ends with rates, ratios, proportions, and percents with a focus on converting units.

## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

- **MP1**: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **MP4**: Model with mathematics.

- **MP6**: Attend to precision.

#### High School — Number and Quantity

##### Quantities

- **N-Q.A.1**: Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems; choose and interpret units consistently in formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the origin in graphs and data displays.

- **N-Q.A.3**: Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities.

#### High School — Algebra

##### Creating Equations

- **A-CED.A.1**: Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems. _Include equations arising from linear and quadratic functions, and simple rational and exponential functions._

- **A-CED.A.4**: Rearrange formulas to highlight a quantity of interest, using the same reasoning as in solving equations. _For example, rearrange Ohm’s law V = IR to highlight resistance R._

##### Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities

- **A-REI.A.1**: Explain each step in solving a simple equation as following from the equality of numbers asserted at the previous step, starting from the assumption that the original equation has a solution. Construct a viable argument to justify a solution method.

- **A-REI.B.3**: Solve linear equations and inequalities in one variable, including equations with coefficients represented by letters.

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9–10)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

- **CRP2**: Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

- **CRP4**: Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

- **CRP6**: Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

- **CRP8**: Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **CRP10**: Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

- **CRP11**: Use technology to enhance productivity.

#### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation

## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- Can equations that appear to be different be equivalent?

- How can you solve equations?

- What kinds of relationships can proportions represent?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- Equations can describe, explain, and predict various aspects of the real world. Students solve one-step, two-step, and multi-step linear equations, as well as equations with variables on both sides.

- If two ratios are equal and a quantity in one of the ratios is unknown, the unknown quantity can be found by writing and solving a proportion.

- Percents represent another application of proportions. The percent proportion can be used to solve for any one of the missing components and to solve percent increase and decrease problems.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- Vocabulary including conversion factor, cross products, Cross Products Property, formula, identity, inverse operations, isolate, literal equation, percent change, proportion, rate, ratio, scale, similar figures, and unit rate.

- Ratios and rates can be used to compare quantities and make conversions.

- Proportional reasoning can be used to find missing side lengths in similar figures.

### Unit learning expectations (Ability)

_Students will be able to..._

- Solve one-step equations in one variable.

- Solve two-step equations in one variable.

- Solve multi-step equations in one variable.

- Solve equations with variables on both sides.

- Identify equations that are identities or have no solution.

- Rewrite and use literal equations and formulas.

- Find ratios and rates.

- Convert units and rates.

- Solve and apply proportions.

- Find missing lengths in similar figures.

- Use similar figures when measuring indirectly.

- Solve percent problems using proportions.

- Solve percent problems using the percent equation.
