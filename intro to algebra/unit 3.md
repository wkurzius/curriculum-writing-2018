### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9–10)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- How do you represent relationships between quantities that are not equal?

- Can inequalities that appear to be different be equivalent?

- How can you solve inequalities?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- Just as properties of equality can be used to solve equations, properties of inequality can be used to solve inequalities (including multi-step and compound inequalities).

- Just as equivalent equations can be used to solve equations, equivalent inequalities can be used to solve inequalities (including multi-step and compound inequalities).

- Just as equations can be solved using the properties of equality, inequalities (including multi-step and compound inequalities) can be solved using the properties of inequality.

- Absolute value equations and inequalities can be solved by first isolating the absolute value expression, if necessary, then writing an equivalent pair of linear equations or inequalities.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- Vocabulary including complement of a set, compound inequality, disjoint sets, empty set, intersection, interval notation, roster form, set-builder notation, union, and universal set.

- An inequality is a mathematical sentence that uses an inequality symbol to compare the values of two expressions. Inequalities can be represented with symbols. Their solutions can be represented on a number line.

- An equivalent pair of linear equations or inequalities can be used to solve absolute value equations and inequalities.

### Unit learning expectations (Ability)

_Students will be able to..._

- Write, graph, and identify solutions of inequalities.

- Use addition or subtraction to solve inequalities.

- Use multiplication or division to solve inequalities.

- Solve multi-step inequalities.

- Write sets and identify subsets.

- Find the complement of a set.

- Solve and graph inequalities containing the word _and_

- Solve and graph inequalities containing the word _or_

- Solve equations and inequalities involving absolute value

- Find the union and intersection of sets.
