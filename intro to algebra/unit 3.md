## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- How do you represent relationships between quantities that are not equal?
- Can inequalities that appear to be different be equivalent?
- How can you solve inequalities?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- Just as properties of equality can be used to solve equations, properties of inequality can be used to solve inequalities (including multi-step and compound inequalities).
- Just as equivalent equations can be used to solve equations, equivalent inequalities can be used to solve inequalities (including multi-step and compound inequalities).
- Just as equations can be solved using the properties of equality, inequalities (including multi-step and compound inequalities) can be solved using the properties of inequality.
- Absolute value equations and inequalities can be solved by first isolating the absolute value expression, if necessary, then writing an equivalent pair of linear equations or inequalities.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- Vocabulary including complement of a set, compound inequality, disjoint sets, empty set, intersection, interval notation, roster form, set-builder notation, union, and universal set.
- An inequality is a mathematical sentence that uses an inequality symbol to compare the values of two expressions. Inequalities can be represented with symbols. Their solutions can be represented on a number line.
- An equivalent pair of linear equations or inequalities can be used to solve absolute value equations and inequalities.

### Unit learning expectations (Ability)

_Students will be able to..._

- Write, graph, and identify solutions of inequalities.
- Use addition or subtraction to solve inequalities.
- Use multiplication or division to solve inequalities.
- Solve multi-step inequalities.
- Write sets and identify subsets.
- Find the complement of a set.
- Solve and graph inequalities containing the word _and_
- Solve and graph inequalities containing the word _or_
- Solve equations and inequalities involving absolute value
