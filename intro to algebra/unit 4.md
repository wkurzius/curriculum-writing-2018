### New Jersey Student Learning Standards

#### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

##### Standards for Mathematical Practice

- **MP1**: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **MP4**: Model with mathematics.

- **MP8**: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

##### High School — Number and Quantity

###### Quantities

- **N-Q.A.1**: Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems; choose and interpret units consistently in formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the origin in graphs and data displays.

- **N-Q.A.2**: Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.

##### High School — Algebra

###### Seeing structure in expressions

- **A-SSE.A.1a**: Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coefficients.

- **A-SSE.A.1b**: Interpret complicated expressions by viewing one or more of their parts as a single entity. _For example, interpret P(1+r)ⁿ as the product of P and a factor not depending on P._

###### Creating equations

- **A.CED.A.2**: Create equations in two or more variables to represent relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.

###### Reasoning with equations and inequalities

- **A-REI.D.10**: Understand that the graph of an equation in two variables is the set of all its solutions plotted in the coordinate plane, often forming a curve (which could be a line).

- **A-REI.D.11**: Explain why the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs of the equations y = f(x) and y = g(x) intersect are the solutions of the equation f(x) = g(x); find the solutions approximately, e.g., using technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find successive approximations. Include cases where f(x) and/or g(x) are linear, polynomial, rational, absolute value, exponential, and logarithmic functions.

#### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9–10)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

#### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

#### 21st Century Life and Careers

##### Career Ready Practices

- **CRP2**: Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

- **CRP4**: Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

- **CRP6**: Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

- **CRP8**: Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **CRP10**: Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

- **CRP11**: Use technology to enhance productivity.

##### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation

- **9.2.12.C.1**: Review career goals and determine steps necessary for attainment.

- **9.2.12.C.9**: Analyze the correlation between personal and financial behavior and employability.

### Learning expectations

#### Unit essential questions

- How can you represent and describe a function?

- Can functions describe real-world situations?

#### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- The value of one variable may be uniquely determined by the value of another variable.

- Functions (linear and nonlinear) are a special type of relation where each value in the domain is paired with exactly one value in the range. Some functions can be graphed or represented by equations.

- Arithmetic sequences have function rules that can be used to find any term of the sequence.

- The set of all solutions of an equation forms its graph. A graph may include solutions that do no appear in a table. A real-world graph should show only points that make sense in the given situation.

- Many real-world functional relationships can be represented by equations. Equations can be used to find the solution of given real-world problems.

#### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- Vocabulary including artithmetic sequence, common difference, continuous graph, dependent variable, discrete graph, domain, function, function notation, independent variable, range, relation, sequence, and vertical line test.

- A relationship between quantities may be represented using words, tables, equations, sets of ordered pairs, and graphs.

- Graphs can be used to visually represent the relationship between two variable quantities as they change.

#### Unit learning expectations (Ability)

_Students will be able to..._

- Represent mathematical relationships using graphs.

- Identify and represent patterns that describe linear functions.

- Identify and represent patterns that describe nonlinear functions.

- Graph equations that represent functions.

- Write equations that represent functions.

- Determine whether a relation is a function.

- Find domain and range and use function notation.

- Identify and extend patterns in sequences.

- Represent arithmetic sequences using function notation.
