# Unit 5: Linear functions

## Unit Overview

**Content area:** Introduction to Algebra

**Unit title:** Linear functions

**Unit time frame:** 5 weeks

**Target Course/Grade Level:** 9

**Unit Summary:** The unit begins with a look at rate of change and slope followed by direct variation. It then moves on to the different forms of linear equations including slope-intercept, point-slope, and standard forms. It follows with determing if lines are parallel or pendicular, then with scatter plots and trend lines and lastly absolute value functions.
