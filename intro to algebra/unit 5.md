# Unit 5: Linear functions

## Unit Overview

- **Content area**: Introduction to Algebra

- **Unit title**: Linear functions

- **Unit time frame**: 26 days

- **Target Course/Grade Level**: 9

- **Unit Summary**: The unit begins with a look at rate of change and slope followed by direct variation. It then moves on to the different forms of linear equations including slope-intercept, point-slope, and standard forms. It follows with determing if lines are parallel or pendicular, then with scatter plots and trend lines and lastly absolute value functions.

## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

- **MP1**: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **MP2**: Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

- **MP4**: Model with mathematics.

#### High School — Number and Quantity

##### Quantities

- **N-Q.A.1**: Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems; choose and interpret units consistently in formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the origin in graphs and data displays.

- **N-Q.A.2**: Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.

#### High School — Algebra

##### Seeing structure in expressions

- **A-SSE.A.1a**: Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coefficients.

- **A-SSE.A.2**: Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it. _For example, see x⁴ – y⁴ as (x²)² – (y²)² , thus recognizing it as a difference of squares that can be factored as (x² – y²)(x² + y²)._

##### Creating equations

- **A-CED.A.2**: Create equations in two or more variables to represent relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.

#### High School — Functions

##### Interpreting functions

- **F-IF.B.4**: For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the relationship. _Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity._

- **F-IF.B.6**: Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function (presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.

- **F-IF.C.7a**: Graph linear and quadratic functions and show intercepts, maxima, and minima.

- **F-IF.C.7b**: Graph square root, cube root, and piecewise-defined functions, including step functions and absolute value functions.

##### Building functions

- **F-BF.A.1a**: Determine an explicit expression, a recursive process, or steps for calculation from a context.

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9–10)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

- **CRP2**: Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

- **CRP4**: Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

- **CRP6**: Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

- **CRP8**: Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **CRP10**: Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

- **CRP11**: Use technology to enhance productivity.

#### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation

- **9.2.12.C.1**: Review career goals and determine steps necessary for attainment.

- **9.2.12.C.9**: Analyze the correlation between personal and financial behavior and employability.

## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- What does the slope of a line indicate about the line?

- What information does the equation of a line give you?

- How can you make predctions based on a scatter plot?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- Ratios can be used to show a realtionship between changing quantities, such as vertical and horizontal change.

- The relationship between two lines can be determined by comparing theri slopes and y-intercepts.

- Absolute value equations can be graphed quickly by shifting the graph of y = |x|.

- Two sets of numerical data can be graphed as ordered pairs. If the two sets of data are related, a line on the graph can be used to estimate or predict values.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- Vocabulary including absolute value function, correlation, direct variation, inverse function, linear equation, line of best fit, opposite reciprocals, parallel lines, perpendicular lines, piecewise function, point-slope form, rate of change, scatter plot, slope, slope-intercept form, standard form, step function, trend line, x-intercept, y-intercept.

- If the ratio of two variables is constant, then the variables have a special relationship called a direct variation.

- A line on a graph can be represented by a linear equation. Forms of linear equations include the slope-intercept, point-slope, and standard forms.

### Unit learning expectations (Ability)
