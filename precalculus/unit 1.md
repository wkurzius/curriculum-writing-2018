#### High School — Functions

##### Trigonometric Functions

- **F-TF.A.3**: Use special triangles to determine geometrically the values of sine, cosine, tangent for π/3, π/4 and π/6, and use the unit circle to express the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for _x_, π+_x_, and 2π–_x_ in terms of their values for _x_, where _x_ is any real number.

- **F-TF.A.4**: Use the unit circle to explain symmetry (odd and even) and periodicity of trigonometric functions.
