### New Jersey Student Learning Standards

#### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

##### Standards for Mathematical Practice

- **MP1**: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **MP2**: Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

- **MP3**: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.

##### High School — Statistics and Probability

###### Using Probability to Make Decisions

- **S-MD.A.1**: Define a random variable for a quantity of interest by assigning a numerical value to each event in a sample space; graph the corresponding probability distribution using the same graphical displays as for data distributions.

- **S-MD.A.2**: Calculate the expected value of a random variable; interpret it as the mean of the probability distribution.

- **S-MD.A.3**: Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which theoretical probabilities can be calculated; find the expected value. For example, find the theoretical probability distribution for the number of correct answers obtained by guessing on all five questions of a multiple-choice test where each question has four choices, and find the expected grade under various grading schemes.

- **S-MD.A.4**: Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which probabilities are assigned empirically; find the expected value. For example, find a current data distribution on the number of TV sets per household in the United States, and calculate the expected number of sets per household. How many TV sets would you expect to find in 100 randomly selected households?

#### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9–10)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

#### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

#### 21st Century Life and Careers

### Learning expectations

#### Unit essential questions

- How do we best summarize and display a particular set of data?

- What kinds of questions can be answered using different graphical displays and numerical summaries?

- How can you judge the effectiveness of regression?

#### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- Data needs to be summarized and displayed in an appropriate way in order to extract meaning from it.

- It is important to understand how data was collected in order to draw valid conclusions from it. Statistical analysis and data displays often reveal patterns that may not be obvious.

- Mathematical models, created using regression, can be useful for making predictions about the future.

#### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- Different ways to sample data.

#### Unit learning expectations (Ability)

_Students will be able to..._

- Univariate Data

  - Apply various sampling methods to collect data.

  - Represent data graphically using box plots, histograms, and cumulative frequency plots.

  - Represent data numerically via measures of central tendency and spread.

  - Interpret graphical and numerical representations of data.

- Bivariate Data

  - Calculate the correlation for a set of bivariate data.

  - Use technology to create regression models (consider linear, quadratic, exponential, trigonometric, logarithmic, power, and polynomial function).

  - Determine and interpret the coefficient of determination.

  - Determine the best fit model for a set of data.
