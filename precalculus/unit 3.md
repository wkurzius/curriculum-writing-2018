## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

- **MP1**: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **MP2**: Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

- **MP3**: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.

- **MP4**: Model with mathematics.

- **MP5**: Use appropriate tools strategically.

- **MP6**: Attend to precision.

- **MP7**: Look for and make use of structure.

- **MP8**: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

#### High School — Number and Quantity

##### The Complex Number System

- **N-CN.A.3**: Find the conjugate of a complex number; use conjugates to find moduli and quotients of complex numbers.

- **N-CN.B.4**: Represent complex numbers on the complex plane in rectangular and polar form (including real and imaginary numbers), and explain why the rectangular and polar forms of a given complex number represent the same number.

- **N-CN.B.5**: Represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and conjugation of complex numbers geometrically on the complex plane; use properties of this representation for computation. _For example, (-1 + √3i)³ = 8 because (-1+ √3i) has modulus 2 and argument 120°._

##### Vector and Matrix Quantities

- **N-VM.A.1**: Recognize vector quantities as having both magnitude and direction. Represent vector quantities by directed line segments, and use appropriate symbols for vectors and their magnitudes (e.g., **_v_**, |**_v_**|, ||**_v_**||, _v_)

- **N-VM.A.2**: Find the components of a vector by subtracting the coordinates of an initial point from the coordinates of a terminal point.

- **N-VM.A.3**: Solve problems involving velocity and other quantities that can be represented by vectors.

- **N-VM.B.4**: Add and subtract vectors.

- **N-VM.B.4a**: Add vectors end-to-end, component-wise, and by the parallelogram rule. Understand that the magnitude of a sum of two vectors is typically not the sum of the magnitudes.

- **N-VM.B.4b**: Given two vectors in magnitude and direction form, determine the magnitude and direction of their sum.

- **N-VM.B.4c**: Understand vector subtraction **_v_** – **_w_** as **_v_** + (–**_w_**), where –**_w_** is the additive inverse of **_w_**, with the same magnitude as **_w_**: and pointing in the opposite direction. Represent vector subtraction graphically by connecting the tips in the appropriate order, and perform vector subtraction component-wise.

- **N-VM.B.5**: Multiply a vector by a scalar.

- **N-VM.B.5a**: Represent scalar multiplication graphically by scaling vectors and possibly reversing their direction; perform scalar multiplication component-wise, e.g., as _c(v_x , v_y) = (cv_x , cv_y )_.

- **N-VM.B.5b**: Compute the magnitude of a scalar multiple _c**v**_ using ||_c**v**_|| = |_c_|**_v_**. Compute the direction of _c**v**_ knowing that when |_c_|**_v_** ≠ 0, the direction of _c**v**_ is either along **_v_** (for _c_ > 0) or against **_v_**: (for _c_ < 0).

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9–10)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

- **CRP2**: Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

- **CRP4**: Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

- **CRP6**: Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

- **CRP8**: Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **CRP10**: Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

- **CRP11**: Use technology to enhance productivity.

#### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation

- **9.2.12.C.1**: Review career goals and determine steps necessary for attainment.

- **9.2.12.C.9**: Analyze the correlation between personal and financial behavior and employability.
