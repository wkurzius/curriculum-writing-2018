#### High School — Algebra

##### Seeing Structure in Expressions

- **A-SSE.A.2**: Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it. _For example, see x⁴ – y⁴ as (x²)² – (y²)² , thus recognizing it as a difference of squares that can be factored as (x² – y²)(x² + y²)._

- **A-SSE.B.3**: Choose and produce an equivalent form of an expression to reveal and explain properties of the quantity represented by the expression.

##### Creating Equations

- **A-CED.A.2**: Create equations in two or more variables to represent relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9-10)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- When is the parametric form of an equation more useful than a rectangular equation, and what additional information can it provide?

- What are the advantages and disadvantages of rectangular, parametric, and polar coordinate systems?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- Parametric equations can be used to model real time motion whereas equivalent rectangular equations with the parameter eliminated cannot show the motion of the object even though the path is the same.

- Mathematicians use many different graphing systems to analyze the relationship between variables, including rectangular, polar and parametric.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- Parametric equations are useful for expressing the position of an object as a function of time.

- Polar coordinates consist of distance and angle

### Unit learning expectations (Ability)
