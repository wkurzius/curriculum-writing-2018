## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

- **MP1**: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **MP2**: Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

- **MP3**: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.

- **MP4**: Model with mathematics.

- **MP5**: Use appropriate tools strategically.

- **MP6**: Attend to precision.

- **MP7**: Look for and make use of structure.

- **MP8**: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

#### High School — Algebra

##### Seeing Structure in Expressions

- **A-SSE.B.4**: Derive and/or explain the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series (when the common ratio is not 1), and use the formula to solve problems. _For example, calculate mortgage payments._

#### High School — Functions

##### Interpretting Functions

- **F-IF.A.3**: Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers. _For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) for n ≥ 1._

##### Building Functions

- **F-BF.A.1a**: Determine an explicit expression, a recursive process, or steps for calculation from a context.

- **F-BF.A.2**: Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms.

##### Linear and Exponential Models

- **F-LE.A.2**: Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 11–12)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

- **CRP2**: Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

- **CRP4**: Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

- **CRP6**: Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

- **CRP8**: Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **CRP10**: Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

- **CRP11**: Use technology to enhance productivity.

#### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation

- **9.2.12.C.1**: Review career goals and determine steps necessary for attainment.

- **9.2.12.C.9**: Analyze the correlation between personal and financial behavior and employability.

## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- To what extent are arithmetic sequences linear and geometric sequences exponential?

- How can an infinite amount of numbers add up to a finite quantity?

- What is the difference between an explicit and recursive rule?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- A sequence is a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers.

- An arithmetic sequence can be expressed as a linear function.

- A geometric sequence can be expressed as an exponential function.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- If a sequence is convergent if it has a limit. It is divergent if it does not.

- A sequence is arithmetic if the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

- A sequence is geometric if the ratio between consecutive terms is constant.
