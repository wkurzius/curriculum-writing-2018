Include cases where _f(x)_ and/or _g(x)_ are linear, polynomial, rational, absolute value, exponential, and logarithmic functions.

#### High School — Functions

##### Interpreting Functions

- **F-IF.C.7d**: Graph rational functions, identifying zeros and asymptotes when suitable factorizations are available, and showing end behavior.

- **F-IF.C.7e**: Graph exponential and logarithmic functions, showing intercepts and end behavior, and trigonometric functions, showing period, midline, and amplitude.

##### Building Functions

- **F-BF.B.4b**: Verify by composition that one function is the inverse of another.

- **F-BF.B.4c**: Read values of an inverse function from a graph or a table, given that the function has an inverse.

- **F-BF.B.4d**: Produce an invertible function from a non-invertible function by restricting the domain.

## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- What are the similarities and differences among transformations of all the parent functions?

- Why is it important to study transformations of functions?

- How can one function “undo” another function?

- How can we use functions to model and analyze a real-life situation?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- Relations and functions can be represented numerically, graphically, algebraically, and/or verbally.

- Changes to a function in algebraic form result in predictable changes to its graph.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- The average rate of change between two points is the slope of the line through those points.

- The different symmetries a function can have.

- The horizontal line test can be used to determine if a function has an inverse function.

### Unit learning expectations (Ability)
