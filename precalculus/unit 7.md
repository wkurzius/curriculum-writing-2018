#### High School — Algebra

##### Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities

- **A-REI.A.2**: Solve simple rational and radical equations in one variable, and give examples showing how extraneous solutions may arise.

- **A-REI.B**: Solve equations and inequalities in one variable

- **A-REI.C**: Solve systems of equations

- **A-REI.D**: Represent and solve equations and inequalities graphically

- **A-REI.D.10**: Understand that the graph of an equation in two variables is the set of all its solutions plotted in the coordinate plane, often forming a curve (which could be a line).

- **A-REI.D.11**: Explain why the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs of the equations _y = f(x)_ and _y = g(x)_ intersect are the solutions of the equation _f(x) = g(x)_; find the solutions approximately, e.g., using technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find successive approximations. Include cases where _f(x)_ and/or _g(x)_ are linear, polynomial, rational, absolute value, exponential, and logarithmic functions.

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 11–12)
