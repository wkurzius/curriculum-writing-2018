# Unit 8: Limits

## Unit Overview

- **Content area**: Precalculus

- **Unit title**: Limits

- **Unit time frame**: 3–4 weeks

- **Target Course/Grade Level**: 11–12

- **Unit Summary**: This unit introduces limits and derivitives. Students will find limits numerically first, then move to algebraic approaches. They then will find instantaneous rates of change and derivitives.

## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

- **MP1**: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **MP2**: Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

- **MP3**: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.

- **MP4**: Model with mathematics.

- **MP5**: Use appropriate tools strategically.

- **MP6**: Attend to precision.

- **MP7**: Look for and make use of structure.

- **MP8**: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

#### High School — Functions

##### Interpreting Functions

- **F-IF.B.4**: For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the relationship. Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.

- **F-IF.B.6**: Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function (presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.

- **F-IF.C.7**: Graph functions expressed symbolically and show key features of the graph, by hand in simple cases and using technology for more complicated cases.

##### Building Functions

- **F-BF.B.3**: Identify the effect on the graph of replacing _f(x)_ by _f(x) + k_, _k f(x)_, _f(kx)_, and _f(x + k)_ for specific values of _k_ (both positive and negative); find the value of _k_ given the graphs. Experiment with cases and illustrate an explanation of the effects on the graph using technology. _Include recognizing even and odd functions from their graphs and algebraic expressions for them._

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 11–12)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

- **CRP2**: Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

- **CRP4**: Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

- **CRP6**: Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

- **CRP8**: Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **CRP10**: Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

- **CRP11**: Use technology to enhance productivity.

#### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation

- **9.2.12.C.1**: Review career goals and determine steps necessary for attainment.

- **9.2.12.C.9**: Analyze the correlation between personal and financial behavior and employability.

## Learning expectations

### Unit essential questions

- What can the limit of a function tell us about the behavior of a function?

- What is the importance of understanding the rate of change of a function, and how does the slope of the tangent line contribute to that understanding?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- The concept of a limit is fundamental to calculus.

- The slope of a line tangent to a graph can be found using limits.

### Unit learning expectations (Knowledge)

_Students will know..._

- The left and right-hand limits of a function approach the same point, the limit exits.
