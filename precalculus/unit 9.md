#### High School — Statistics and Probability

##### Conditional Probability and the Rules of Probability

- **S-CP.A.1**: Describe events as subsets of a sample space (the set of outcomes) using characteristics (or categories) of the outcomes, or as unions, intersections, or complements of other events (“or,” “and,” “not”).

- **S-CP.A.2**: Understand that two events A and B are independent if the probability of A and B occurring together is the product of their probabilities, and use this characterization to determine if they are independent.

- **S-CP.A.3**: Understand the conditional probability of _A_ given _B_ as _P(A_ and _B)/P(B)_, and interpret independence of _A_ and _B_ as saying that the conditional probability of _A_ given _B_ is the same as the probability of _A_, and the conditional probability of _B_ given _A_ is the same as the probability of _B_.

- **S-CP.A.4**: Construct and interpret two-way frequency tables of data when two categories are associated with each object being classified. Use the two-way table as a sample space to decide if events are independent and to approximate conditional probabilities. _For example, collect data from a random sample of students in your school on their favorite subject among math, science, and English. Estimate the probability that a randomly selected student from your school will favor science given that the student is in tenth grade. Do the same for other subjects and compare the results._

- **S-CP.A.5**: Recognize and explain the concepts of conditional probability and independence in everyday language and everyday situations. _For example, compare the chance of having lung cancer if you are a smoker with the chance of being a smoker if you have lung cancer._

- **S-CP.B.6**: Find the conditional probability of _A_ given _B_ as the fraction of _B_’s outcomes that also belong to _A_, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.

- **S-CP.B.7**: Apply the Addition Rule, _P(A_ or _B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A_ and _B)_, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.

- **S-CP.B.8**:Apply the general Multiplication Rule in a uniform probability model, _P(A_ and _B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B)_, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.

- **S-CP.B.9**: Use permutations and combinations to compute probabilities of compound events and solve problems.

##### Using Probability to Make Decisions

- **S-MD.A.2**: Calculate the expected value of a random variable; interpret it as the mean of the probability distribution.

- **S-MD.B.5**: Weigh the possible outcomes of a decision by assigning probabilities to payoff values and finding expected values.

- **S-MD.B.5a**: Find the expected payoff for a game of chance. _For example, find the expected winnings from a state lottery ticket or a game at a fast food restaurant._

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9–10)

- **NJSLSA.R1**: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- **NJSLSA.R4**: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

### Technology — Educational Technology

- **8.1.12.B.2**: Apply previous content knowledge by creating and piloting a digital learning game or tutorial.

### 21st Century Life and Careers

#### Career Ready Practices

- **CRP2**: Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.

- **CRP4**: Communicate clearly and effectively and with reason.

- **CRP6**: Demonstrate creativity and innovation.

- **CRP8**: Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

- **CRP10**: Plan education and career paths aligned to personal goals.

- **CRP11**: Use technology to enhance productivity.

#### Career Awareness, Exploration, and Preparation
