## New Jersey Student Learning Standards

### New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Mathematics

#### Standards for Mathematical Practice

**MP1** Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

**MP4** Model with mathematics.

**MP8** Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

#### High School — Number and Quantity

##### Quantities

**N-Q.A.1** Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems;
choose and interpret units consistently in formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the
origin in graphs and data displays.

**N-Q.A.2** Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.

#### High School — Algebra

##### Seeing structure in expressions

**A-SSE.A.1a** Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coefficients.

**A-SSE.A.1b** Interpret complicated expressions by viewing one or more of their parts as a single entity.
_For example, interpret P(1+r)ⁿ as the product of P and a factor not depending on P._

##### Creating equations

**A.CED.A.2** Create equations in two or more variables to represent relationships between quantities;
graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.

##### Reasoning with equations and inequalities

**A-REI.D.10** Understand that the graph of an equation in two variables is the set of all its solutions
plotted in the coordinate plane, often forming a curve (which could be a line).

**A-REI.D.11** Explain why the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs of the equations y = f(x) and y
= g(x) intersect are the solutions of the equation f(x) = g(x); find the solutions approximately,
e.g., using technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find successive
approximations. Include cases where f(x) and/or g(x) are linear, polynomial, rational,
absolute value, exponential, and logarithmic functions.

### English Language Arts Companion Standards (Grade 9-10)

- Can functions describe real-world situations?

### Unit enduring understanding (Understanding)

_Students will understand..._

- The value of one variable may be uniquely determined by the value of another variable.
- Functions (linear and nonlinear) are a special type of relation where each value in the domain is paired with exactly one value in the range. Some functions can be graphed or represented by equations.
- Arithmetic sequences have function rules that can be used to find any term of the sequence.
- The set of all solutions of an equation forms its graph. A graph may include solutions that do no appear in a table. A real-world graph should show only points that make sense in the given situation.
- Many real-world functional relationships can be represented by equations. Equations can be used to find the solution of given real-world problems.
